  abstract = {The spread of high-speed (broadband) Internet epitomizes the digital revolution. Using German panel data, we test whether the availability of broadband influences fertility choices in a low-fertility setting well known for the difficulty in combining work and family life. We exploit a strategy devised by Falck and colleagues to obtain causal estimates of the impact of broadband on fertility. We find positive effects of broadband availability on the fertility of highly educated women aged 25–45. We further confirm this result using county-level data on total fertility. We show that broadband access significantly increases the share of women reporting home- or part-time working. Furthermore, we find positive effects on time spent with children and overall life satisfaction. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that access to broadband allows highly educated women, but not the less educated, to reconcile career and motherhood, which may promote a ‘digital divide’ in fertility.},

For topographical reasons, Western TV programs, which promoted one/no child families, could not be received in certain parts of East Germany. We find robust evidence that access to West German TV results in lower fertility. This conclusion is robust to alternative model specifications and different data sets. Using individual level information on TV consumption, we employ IV techniques to estimate the direct effect of Western TV consumption on fertility. By using aggregate level fertility data, we furthermore show the robustness of our analysis in a difference-in-difference setting. Our results suggest that individual fertility decisions are affected by role models or information about other ways of life promoted by media.},

  abstract = {Der Rückgang der Kohortenfertilität im Zuge des zweiten demografischen Übergangs wird vor~allem durch den Anstieg der Kinderlosigkeit und den Rückgang des Kinderreichtums verursacht. Welcher dieser Effekte in Deutschland stärker ist, war in der Literatur lange umstritten. Eine exakte Quantifizierung der einzelnen Effekte steht noch aus. In dieser Arbeit wird eine Dekompositionsmethode entwickelt, mit der sich die Stärke der einzelnen demografischen Treiber für den Vergleich zwischen zwei endgültigen Kohortenfertilitätsraten (CTFR) berechnen lässt. Diese Methode wird für den Vergleich der deutschen CTFR für die Jahrgänge 1933–1968, zwischen denen der zweite Geburtenrückgang stattgefunden hat, angewendet. Es wird nach Zwischenphasen und Regionen differenziert. Der Geburtenrückgang lässt sich in vier Komponenten aufteilen: Veränderungen der Kinderlosigkeit und des Kinderreichtums, ein Interaktionseffekt und eine veränderte Relation der Paritäten~1 und~2. Der Effekt der zunehmenden Kinderlosigkeit auf den gesamten CTFR-Rückgang Deutschlands beträgt 25,9\,\%, der der Abnahme des Kinderreichtums 68,0\,\% und der Interaktionseffekt 6,1\,\%. Die Relation der Paritäten~1 und~2 hat sich kaum verändert. Dahinter verbergen sich allerdings zwei völlig unterschiedliche Phasen: Zunächst war ausschließlich der Rückgang kinderreicher Frauen verantwortlich, seit der Kohorte 1947 zu zwei Dritteln die zunehmende Kinderlosigkeit. Die Befunde sind für Theorien des Geburtenrückgangs relevant, da sich Erklärungen der zunehmenden Kinderlosigkeit von solchen des Rückgangs höherer Paritäten deutlich unterscheiden.},

  abstract = {Incorporating the regional context into fertility research has a long standing tradition. However, in Germany, fertility data at the district level only exist for period total fertility rates (TFR), but not for cohort total fertility rates (CTFR). Based on the 2011 census and birth statistics, we estimate the CTFR at the district level and analyse factors influencing their variation.First, we estimate the CTFR for the 1969-72 cohorts in all 402 German districts. The estimated CTFR differ strongly across German districts ranging between 1.05 and 2.01. Further, the estimated CTFR differ substantially from the known TFR values. This is mainly due to biases in the tempo component of the TFR, which are crucial in East German districts, university cities and in urban-rural comparisons. Therefore, the estimated CTFR allow for a better assessment of fertility differences across districts.Second, we analyse the differences in the newly estimated CTFR employing regression models. Composition effects such as a low proportion of highly educated women, a high share of Catholics or immigrants are significantly associated with higher CTFR in West German districts. However, regional opportunities are also important: A low population density, the availability of relatively spacious dwellings, a surplus of males, a small service sector and low unemployment rates are associated with higher fertility. Overall the analyses show regional factors are highly relevant for fertility.},

This paper estimates the effects of parental retirement on the fertility of their adult children. We use representative panel data from Germany to link observations on parents and their adult children. We exploit eligibility ages for early retirement for identification in a regression discontinuity and pension reforms in a difference-in-differences design. The results suggest that parents’ retirement positively influences the fertility of their adult children, which is mainly driven by an increase in the likelihood of having a second birth. However, while parental retirement affects the timing of the fertility of their adult children, it does not affect the children's total fertility.},

  abstract = {Although a growing literature explores the relationship between migration and fertility, far less scholarship has examined how migrant childbearing varies over time, including across migrant cohorts. I extend previous research by exploring migrant-cohort differences in fertility and the role of changing composition by education and type of family migration. Using 1984–2016 German Socio-Economic Panel data, I investigate the transition into first, second, and third birth among foreign-born women in West Germany. Results from an event-history analysis reveal that education and type of family migration—including marriage migration and family reunions—contribute to differences in first birth across migrant cohorts. Specifically, more rapid entry into first birth among recent migrants from Turkey stems from a greater representation of marriage migrants across arrival cohorts, while increasing education is associated with reduced first birth propensities among recent migrants from Southern Europe. I also find variation in the risk of higher parity transitions across migrant cohorts, particularly lower third birth risks among recent arrivals from Turkey, likely a result of changing exposures within origin and destination contexts. These findings suggest that as political and socioeconomic circumstances vary within origin and destination contexts, selection, adaptation, and socialization processes jointly shape childbearing behavior.},

  abstract = {For the German context, we investigate whether the number of children ever born differs between mixed unions (exogamous unions between natives and migrants or migrant descendants) and endogamous unions (unions among co-ethnics). Our theoretical considerations are derived from assimilation theories, which view exogamous unions as indicators of assimilation processes, and the framework on migrant fertility. The migrant (or descendant) partner in an exogamous union may adapt to the majority group, both partners may adapt to each other, or both partners may constitute a selected group in their fertility preferences. However, due to the higher likelihood of conflicts within the partnership and of separation, exogamy may disrupt family formation processes and depress couples’ fertility. Drawing on data from the GSOEP (1984–2020), we estimate generalized Poisson regressions. The results reveal that the number of children ever born is higher in exogamous unions than in endogamous native couples. This general pattern largely persists across migrant generations and regions of origin, but we identify gender differences. While fertility in exogamous unions of native women/migrant (descendant) men is not statistically different from fertility in native/native couples, unions of migrant (descendant) women/native men have more children, especially when controlling for socio-demographic confounders. Our results demonstrate that in the German context, exogamy does not lead to fertility disruptions, and is not straightforwardly associated with assimilation to the fertility of the majority group. Instead, differences in gendered partner choice patterns and life-course transitions may influence the number of children exogamous couples have.},

Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we analyze the effects of exposure to globalization on fertility and marital behavior in Germany, which was a lowest-low fertility setting until recently. We find that exposure to greater import competition from Eastern Europe led to worse labor market outcomes and lower fertility rates. In contrast, workers in industries that benefited from increased exports had better employment prospects and higher fertility. These effects are driven by low-educated individuals, married men, and full-time workers and reflect changes in the likelihood of having any child (the extensive margin). We find evidence of some fertility postponement and significant effects on completed fertility, but we see little evidence of a significant impact on marital behavior. Our results inform the public debate on fertility rates in settings with lowest-low fertility, such as Germany, during the period under investigation.},

  abstract = {Members of the political elite have far-reaching influence on the overall society. In this paper, we analyse fertility patterns among the German political elite for two reasons: First, we learn more about the living circumstances of a subgroup that makes crucial decisions and could serve as a role model for the general population. Second, we gain insight into the association between social status and fertility patterns at the top tier of the status distribution. We collect biographical data from all high-rank politicians in Germany in 2006 and/or 2017, comprising 184 women and 353 men. We compare fertility patterns in this subgroup to the general population, as well as we differentiate the number of children by politicians’ gender, region (eastern/western Germany), party affiliation, and other variables. Results show that, on average, male politicians have relatively many children: 2.0 in western Germany, and 2.2 in eastern Germany. Female politicians have very few children in western Germany (1.3) and relatively many in eastern Germany (1.9). The east-west gap between men and women is entirely driven by differences in childlessness. For men, the observation of high fertility in this high-status group could hint towards a positive association between social status and fertility at the top of the status distribution. For women, large east-west differences in this subgroup could mean that the association between social status and fertility at the top of the status distribution might be negative or positive, depending on macro-level characteristics such as gender norms and work-family reconciliation policies. Zusammenfassung Mitglieder der politischen Elite üben erheblichen Einfluss auf das gesellschaftliche Zusammenleben aus. Aus zwei Gründen analysieren wir in diesem Artikel Fertilitätsmuster von deutschen Spitzenpolitikern: Erstens, um mehr über die Lebensumstände einer Gruppe zu erfahren, die wichtige Entscheidungen trifft und eine Vorbildfunktion für die Bevölkerung einnehmen kann, und zweitens, um ein besseres Verständnis über den Zusammenhang zwischen Sozialstatus und Fertilität am oberen Ende der Sozialstatus-Skala zu erhalten, indem wir exemplarisch eine Gruppe mit besonders hohem Sozialstatus analysieren. Wir sammeln biographische Daten von allen Personen, die in Jahr 2006 und/oder 2017 eine politische Elitenposition in Deutschland innehaben (184 Frauen und 353 Männer) und vergleichen die Kinderzahl der Politikerinnen und Politiker mit denen der Gesamtbevölkerung. Zusätzlich analysieren wir die Kinderzahl der Personen in politischen Ämtern nach Geschlecht, Region (Ost/West), Parteizugehörigkeit sowie weiteren Variablen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass männliche Politiker im Durchschnitt relativ viele Kinder haben, 2,0 in West-, und 2,2 in Ostdeutschland. Politikerinnen in Westdeutschland haben im Durschnitt sehr wenige Kinder (1,3); Politikerinnen in Ostdeutschland haben dagegen vergleichsweise viele Kinder (1,9). Die Ost-West-Unterschiede der durchschnittlichen Kinderzahl lassen sich komplett durch Unterschiede in den Übergangsraten zum ersten Kind erklären. Die vergleichsweise hohe Kinderzahl männlicher Spitzenpolitiker könnte ein Hinweis darauf sein, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Sozialstatus und Fertilität für Männer im oberen Bereich der Statushierarchie positiv ist. Die großen Ost-West-Unterschiede bei Politikerinnen könnten darauf hindeuten, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen Sozialstatus und Fertilität in Abhängigkeit von Makro-Level Faktoren wie Geschlechternormen und die Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie positiv oder negativ sein könnte.},

Using Census records linked with individual biography data, our analysis confirms the commonly found short-term pattern of decreased fertility rates due to a stark imbalance of the sex ratio. Yet, the long-term effects of such an imbalance crucially depend on when in the life cycle fertility is evaluated. We find that female cohorts with low sex ratios have fewer children at younger ages and a larger fraction remains childless. While childlessness remains higher throughout their life cycle, mothers from affected cohorts catch up and even overcompensate at later ages with respect to the number of children. Our preferred reading of this result is that with low sex ratios women select themselves into late motherhood according to their fertility preferences. This interpretation is consistent with the finding that women from affected cohorts expand their childbearing period and accept lower quality matches in the marriage market. Our findings have important implications for understanding the long-term consequences of large population shocks.},

In this study, we examine how the association of unemployment and fertility varies by socio-demographic subgroups using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and from Danish population registers. We find that male unemployment is related to a postponement of first and second childbearing in both countries. The role of female unemployment is less clear at these two parities. Both male and female unemployment is positively correlated with third birth risks. More importantly, our results show that there are strong educational gradients in the unemployment and fertility nexus, and that the relationship between unemployment and fertility varies by socioeconomic group. Fertility tends to be lower during periods of unemployment among highly educated women and men, but not among their less educated counterparts.},

Results highlight the “economic advantage” of men and women in service classes who experience strongly elevated second birth rates. Finally, we demonstrate that upward career mobility post-first birth is associated with higher second birth rates, particularly among men.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for correlated unobserved heterogeneity to correctly identify the relevance of career and education for fertility decisions. By exploiting individual-level life-cycle information on fertility, career and education from large administrative longitudinal datasets, this paper shows that non-linear panel models produce substantially different results than the cross-sectional approaches widely used in previous studies. Higher opportunity costs of having children are found to be associated with lower fertility within a country, while the magnitude of the adjustment differs strongly across countries. In Germany, fertility decisions are found to depend more on individual circumstances than in France, where better public childcare support enhances the compatibility between family and professional life.},

  abstract = {In the German post-reunification context dominated by economic uncertainty and structural change, this paper studies the effects of import shocks from China on the fertility decisions of individuals working in the German manufacturing sector between 1995 and 2016. While focusing on trade shocks related to Chinese imported goods, the paper explores individual fertility via the labor market outcomes of manufacturing workers, roughly a fifth of German employment. I investigate the gender-specific effects of Chinese import competition on individual fertility and explain the channels mediating each of them. I find that globalization affects overall fertility negatively, but the effect is positive for women and negative for men. Results indicate a reduction in the employment opportunity of individuals, an increase in marginal employment and higher economic insecurity. There is a substitution effect in the labor supply of women, here prevalently concentrated in low-technology sectors: as female earnings fall and their opportunity cost of work is lower, the prospect of having children possibly becomes a more rewarding alternative. Given concerns over low fertility in Germany, findings are particularly important for understanding the German social and economic structure that enabled the country's post-reunification transformation but also allowed heavy labor market segmentation and atypical work.},

  abstract = {The struggle that women face in reconciling their work and family roles is one of the main explanations proposed for the rapid decline in fertility rates in some developed countries. This study examines the role of the outsourcing of housework in reducing such role incompatibility and in increasing fertility among women in Germany—a country with below-replacement fertility rates, which enacted a series of large-scale schemes from the beginning of the 1990s that give incentives to households to outsource housework. Based on Goode’s role strain theory and by using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, this study analyzed whether women who outsourced housework after the birth of their first child had a higher probability of having a second child. A survival analysis of 3990 person years demonstrates that, controlling for observables, the outsourcing of domestic labor is positively associated with a higher probability of a subsequent second birth in German women.},

  abstract = {Using panel data from childless respondents of the German Family Panel (pairfam, n=3,802 respondents), this paper investigates whether fertility orientations (biographical orientations with respect to fertility) influence the risk of different partnership transitions among German men and women over the age of 18 (for n=14,572 observation periods between two panel waves). Significant influences are found for both gender and partnership transition types, and are generally stronger among men than women and for the transition to a coresidential as opposed to a romantic partnership. Uncertainty about anticipated fertility has a stronger negative impact on transition risks among men than among women. Results strongly suggest that the early stages of the partnership formation process are instrumental in terms of future fertility in Germany, at least to some degree. This indicates that a more comprehensive conceptualisation and analysis of fertility within the life course paradigm (as suggested by Huinink/Kohli 2014) should consider the impacts of fertility orientations on life course events in other dimensions, especially among men. Viewed more broadly, the results also underline two factors: the role of agency in coordinating life course dimensions in time and space in order to maximise individual welfare; and the importance of considering the impacts that anticipation of future life course events will have, as suggested by different theoretical approaches.},
